# Scringo Android Sample App:

I was trying to integrate Scringo for learning and seeing what all features it has got. I tried their sample app from the Github link
https://github.com/Scringo/ScringoSimpleSample-android but it didn't work out-of-box. I then decided to merge library with Sample project
and it worked. Hope it will save someone's else time looking at it before Scringo team fixes the problem for smooth integration.

# Before Running App:
Replace <YOUR_SCRINGO_APP_ID> in MainActivity.java with your Scringo App Id (See below how to obtain it if you don't have one already).
